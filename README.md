# 3Dcell_tracking_DSAA2019
This repository contains the codes for the paper we submitted to IEEE DSAA 2019 :
_"Lightweight and Scalable Particle Tracking and Motion Clustering of 3D Cell Trajectories"_

There are 3 version of our codes: Serial, The local dask and the dask on cluster version. 

* How to run the code? *
It depends on your data. First you need to store all the data on your local machine, then inside the code there are two
parameters that should be changed:
